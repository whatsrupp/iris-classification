# Classifying Fisher's Iris data set with python

This is my first baby machine learning project so take it easy. Also, it's pretty much 100% copied from [this](http://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/) tutorial put together by the main man Jason Brownlee.

It was very handholdy, but I have literally zero idea about what I'm doing so I was kind of relieved about that.

## How to running this steaming hot flowery mess
### 1) Get pip 'n' python 
I'm not going to go into this in too much detail as I'd rather be coding. A quick google 'installing pip' and installing python' should do the job.
### 2) Install Packages
This requires a number of scipi packages
- scipy
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- sklearn

```
pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib pandas sklearn
```
any problems with the install and I would head over [here](https://www.scipy.org/install.html). Alternatively, I'd just leave it, as this isn't much to look at anyway.

### 3) Launch

Rather hysterically, the interesting output from this project is a tiny table of data. It's not too flasy but it's about what's under the hood right?
